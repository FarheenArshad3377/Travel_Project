Mountains are among the most awe-inspiring natural formations on Earth, rising majestically into the sky and serving as symbols of strength, endurance, and timeless beauty. These towering landforms are created by the slow yet powerful forces of tectonic activity, where plates collide and uplift vast sections of the Earth's crust. Each mountain has a story etched into its rugged cliffs and valleys, telling of millions of years of geological evolution.Beyond their grandeur, mountains play a vital role in the Earth's ecosystems. They serve as watersheds, providing fresh water to billions of people through rivers and streams that originate from their snow-covered peaks. Their varied climates and altitudes host an incredible diversity of flora and fauna, many of which are found nowhere else. Mountain forests and grasslands also act as carbon sinks, helping mitigate climate change.",
